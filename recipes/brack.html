<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Barmbrack or brack is a traditional Irish fruitcake or fruit loaf. It was traditionally served at Halloween but is now eaten all year round. It's delicious as-is or spread with a little butter. It is tradition to add objects to the barmbrack which symbolize certain things for the person who receives it in their slice: a coin — wealth or good fortune; a ring — will marry within the year!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>chopped dried mixed fruit</li>

    <li>1 ½ cups hot black tea</li>
    
    <li>2 ½ cups flour</li>
    
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    
    <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Soak dried fruit in hot tea for at least 2 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a round 9-inch cake pan or 9x5-inch loaf pan. Stir flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda together; set aside.</li>
    <li>Lightly beat egg in a large bowl; mix in sugar, marmalade, orange zest, and tea-soaked fruit until well combined. Gently fold in the flour mixture until just combined, then pour into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 2 hours before removing to a wire rack to cool to room temperature. Press the objects of choice into the cake through the bottom before serving.</li>
</ol>
